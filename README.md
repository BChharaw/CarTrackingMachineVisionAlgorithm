This is a modified file of the Simple Depth Viewer of the Orbbec Astra SDK [https://orbbec3d.com] used in compliance with the Apache License, Version 2.0 as a part of the Toyota Innovation Challenge hosted by the University of Waterloo.
 The goal of this hackathon was to modify this depth viewer in C++ to develop a vehicle tracking system and this is the submission for Group 17. Check out the final results of this code at https://bchharaw.github.io/#/projects/cardetection
This code requires an Astra SDK compatible depth camera, the Astra SDK, and the associated desktop drivers. The unmodified SDK and drivers can be found at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ybOR5NLRfRJM09OUw7Nv3fQ8K34Sdg6A?usp=sharing
This code is meant to replace main.cpp in the following location of the SDK provided in the google drive \AstraSDKvs2015-win64-silas (1)\AstraSDKvs2015-win64-silas\samples\sfml\SimpleDepthViewer-SFML
